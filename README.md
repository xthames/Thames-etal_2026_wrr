# metarepo
## [Check out the website for instructions](https://immm-sfa.github.io/metarepo)
`metarepo` is short for meta-repository, a GitHub repository that contains instructions to reproduce results in a published work. This repo is a template for creating your own metarepo.

## Purpose
A meta-repository creates a single point of access for someone to find all of the components that were used to create a published work for the purpose of reproducibility. This repository should contain references to all minted data and software as well as any ancillary code used to transform the source data, create figures for your publication, conduct the experiment, and / or execute the contributing software.

## Abstract
Impacts of climate change on agricultural water demands are deeply uncertain due to complex interactions between precipitation, temperature, and growing season dynamics. For the different agricultural users experiencing these climate impacts, traditional top-down approaches using downscaled climate projections may underrepresent this uncertainty and mask spatial heterogeneities. To address this shortcoming, we develop a multivariate, multisite, copula-based stochastic weather generator for bottom-up exploratory modeling analysis of agricultural water resources systems. Paired with a regional consumptive use model, this generator allows us to investigate differential impacts of climate change on diverse agricultural producers and crops. We demonstrate this framework in the Upper Colorado River Basin within the state of Colorado. Results show that all producers see irrigation requirements increase higher than their historical averages in more than 50% of our sampled realizations, with producers at lower elevations seeing this increase in more than 75% of them. Global sensitivity analysis reveals that adequate access to water impacts producers' effective growing season lengths and thereby which climate variables most control crop water requirement: producers with adequate water are most sensitive to changes in temperature mean and variance while producers without adequate water are most sensitive to changes in precipitation variance---and not mean---with temperature contributions halving. We also find that access to water is more important than crop type, elevation, or location when considering producer sensitivity to climate. These findings demonstrate how differential vulnerability drivers underscore the need for stakeholder-specific assessments that account for spatial heterogeneity and decision-relevant uncertainties in agricultural water demand.

## Code reference
References for each minted software release for all code involved.  

These are generated by Zenodo automatically when conducting a release when Zenodo has been linked to your GitHub repository. The Zenodo references are built by setting the author order in order of contribution to the code using the author's GitHub username.  This citation can, and likely should, be edited without altering the DOI.

If you have modified a codebase that is outside of a formal release, and the modifications are not planned on being merged back into a version, fork the parent repository and add a `.<shortname>` to the version number of the parent and construct your own name.  For example, `v1.2.5.hydro`.
