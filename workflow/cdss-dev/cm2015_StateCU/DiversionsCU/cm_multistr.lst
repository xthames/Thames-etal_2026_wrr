#cm_multistr.lst
# This file identifies all of the multistructures represented in the model. 
# Structures in a multi-structure are located on the different tributaries, but irrigate the same acreage. 
# Multi-structure systems have the combined acreage and demand assigned to a primary structure; 
# however, the water rights are represented at each individual structure, and the model meets the demand 
# from each structure when their water right is in priority.
