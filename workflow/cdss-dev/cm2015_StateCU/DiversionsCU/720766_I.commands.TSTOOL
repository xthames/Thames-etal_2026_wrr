#  MASON EDDY DITCH IRRIGATION DIVERSIONS 7200766
#
#   Documentation from the Phase III model update (Appendix B.4.5) was utilized to determine how this structure functions.
#   Model ID 7200766 represents the municipal diversions by the Ute WCD at the 7200766 HG.
#   After Talking with Tom Crumpton (Ute WCD, 970-464-5563) on 2/22/2006 it was determined the ditch (7200766) was
#   no longer used for irrigation (represented by model ID 7200766_I) after 1983 when Ute transferred these rights
#   to municipal use (represented by model ID 7200766). Thus, diversions were set to -999 from 11/1983 on so zeros
#   for that period were not used when filling missing data prior to 1983.
#   Furthermore, the junior water right associated with WDID 721334 is diverted at the same location; however it is modeled as a separate structure.
